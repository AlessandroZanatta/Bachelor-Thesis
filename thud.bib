pages="420--434",
abstract="Seifert (ACM CCS 2005) recently described a new fault attack against an implementation of RSA signature verification. Seifert's attack differs from the seminal work of Boneh, DeMillo and Lipton (EUROCRYPT 1997) in that it targets a public-key rather than a private-key operation. Here we give a simplified analysis of Seifert's attack and gauge its practicality against RSA moduli of practical sizes. Our intent is to give practice-oriented work estimates rather than asymptotic results. We also suggest an improvement to Seifert's attack which has the following consequences: If an adversary is able to cause random faults in only 4 bits of a 1024-bit RSA modulus stored in a device, then there is a greater than 50{\%} chance that they will be able to make that device accept a signature on a message of their choice. For 2048-bit RSA, 6 bits suffice.",

abstract = {We present a general approach for the symbolic analysis of security protocols that
use Diffie-Hellman exponentiation to achieve advanced security properties. We model
protocols as multiset rewriting systems and security properties as first-order formulas.
We analyze them using a novel constraint-solving algorithm that supports both falsification
and verification, even in the presence of an unbounded number of protocol sessions.
The algorithm exploits the finite variant property and builds on ideas from strand
spaces and proof normal forms. We demonstrate the scope and the effectiveness of our
algorithm on non-trivial case studies. For example, the algorithm successfully verifies
the NAXOS protocol with respect to a symbolic version of the eCK security model.},
