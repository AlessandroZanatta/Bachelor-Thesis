abstract = {We present a general approach for the symbolic analysis of security protocols that
use Diffie-Hellman exponentiation to achieve advanced security properties. We model
protocols as multiset rewriting systems and security properties as first-order formulas.
We analyze them using a novel constraint-solving algorithm that supports both falsification
and verification, even in the presence of an unbounded number of protocol sessions.
The algorithm exploits the finite variant property and builds on ideas from strand
spaces and proof normal forms. We demonstrate the scope and the effectiveness of our
algorithm on non-trivial case studies. For example, the algorithm successfully verifies
the NAXOS protocol with respect to a symbolic version of the eCK security model.},
